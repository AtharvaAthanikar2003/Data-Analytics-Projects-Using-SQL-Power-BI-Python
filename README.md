Hey Everyone, below is a list of Data Analytics projects that I've created and documented here. Descriptions of few projects are not listed as they were based on simple EDA process. 
Feel free to take a look on it !

# Indian Airlines Flight Trends and Insights
**Description**:
India's domestic aviation sector involves high traffic between cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Chennai, Hyderabad and Kolkata but lacks a comprehensive analysis of flight trends.
